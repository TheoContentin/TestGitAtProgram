Mehrio Kurt is a student project of Th√©o Contentin and Steven Arulpragasam into which we attempted to recreate the famous game Tux Karting:

You can play either one or two player mode:
To play as the first player use z, q, s, d.
To play as the second player use i, j,k,l.

The project may run a bit slowly on some computers: a map with low resolution is provided and should help enhance playabily if renamed as the original map.

The menu window must be the last one clicked to have the controls properly working.
